# A Maze

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

## Target Platform: Android

## Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

## Overview
This project demonstrates using waypoints to navigate around a maze with the objective of finding the key that unlocks the door to the temple. I realized that lighting optimization should start as early as possible during development. Developing a consistent taxonomy of all the game objects BEFORE development will be something I practice going forward in the future. It makes changing properties for groups of game objects much easier.
